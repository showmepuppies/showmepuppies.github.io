	<p> This is a webpage that shows you GIFs of adorable animal babies. </p>
	<p> In the future, I would like this page to be a “mini web app”, where you can choose between a number of options and have the site display an animated GIF that suits your cute'n'fluffy needs.</p>
	<p> Examples of options to choose from could include:</p>
	
	
		<li>dogs
		<li>cats
		<li>rhinos
		<li>other
